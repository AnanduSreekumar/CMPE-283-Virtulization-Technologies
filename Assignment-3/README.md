3. **Comment on the Frequency of Exits**
   
   No, the frequency of VM exits is inconsistent and fluctuates based on the specific exit types involved. 
   During a full VM boot, the total exit count unexpectedly drops from over a million (1,106,732) to zero, indicating a highly variable and context-dependent nature of these exits.

4. **Of the Exit Types Defined in the SDM, Which Are the Most Frequent and Least?**
   
   Most Frequent: Exit code 10 was the most frequently used, with 1244875 exits.
   Least Frequent: Least was 29 and 55 with 3 total exits. There were many exit numbers with zero exits.

Note: Assignment 2 and 3 code is in the assignment 2 code folder itself.
