### Team Contribution:
1. **[Anandu Sreekumar](https://github.com/AnanduSreekumar)**

Anandu conducted research on nested virtualization in VMWare and obtained the MSR commands from the SDM manual. I modified CMPE-283-1.c and created functions IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS, IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2, IA32_VMX_EXIT_CTLS. Since my system was crashing, I met with Jeswanth in the library and connected over Zoom to implement the module on Jeswanthâ€™s laptop as described in the following steps.

2. **[Jeswanth Vadlamudi](https://github.com/jeswanthv)**

Jeswanth created VMWare with help of Anandu's research and forked the repo and cloned into the VMWare. Jeswanth build the kernel along with Anandu and Modified CMPE-283-1.c and created functions IA32_VMX_ENTRY_CTLS,IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3
