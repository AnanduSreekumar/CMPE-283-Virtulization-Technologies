### Team Contribution

1. **[Anandu Sreekumar](https://github.com/AnanduSreekumar)**

   Anandu conducted research on nested virtualization in VMWare and obtained the MSR commands from the SDM manual. He modified `CMPE-283-1.c` and created functions `IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS`, `IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2`, and `IA32_VMX_EXIT_CTLS`. Due to system crashes, he collaborated with Jeswanth in the library and connected over Zoom to implement the module on Jeswanthâ€™s laptop, as detailed in the following steps.

2. **[Jeswanth Vadlamudi](https://github.com/jeswanthv)**

   Jeswanth set up VMWare with Anandu's research assistance, forked the repository, and cloned it into VMWare. He built the kernel alongside Anandu and modified `CMPE-283-1.c` to create functions `IA32_VMX_ENTRY_CTLS` and `IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3`.
